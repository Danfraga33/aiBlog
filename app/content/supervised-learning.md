## ðŸŽ¯ What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from **labeled data**â€”meaning each input has a known output. The goal is for the model to find patterns in the data and make predictions on new, unseen data.

### ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

1. **Training Phase**: The model is given input data (**X**) along with correct output labels (**Y**).
2. **Learning Patterns**: It finds relationships between inputs and outputs.
3. **Prediction Phase**: Once trained, it can predict outputs for new inputs.

### ðŸ”¹ Examples:

- **Regression** (e.g., predicting house prices based on square footage).
- **Classification** (e.g., detecting spam emails vs. non-spam).

Supervised learning powers many AI applications, from **chatbots** to **medical diagnosis systems**. ðŸš€
